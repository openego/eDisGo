    "This example shows you the first steps with eDisGo. Grid expansion costs for an example distribution grid are calculated assuming renewable and conventional power plant capacities as stated in the scenario framework of the German Grid Development Plan 2015 (Netzentwicklungsplan) for the year 2035 (scenario B2). Through this, the data structure used in eDisGo is explained and it is shown how to get distribution grid data, how to use the automatic grid reinforcement methodology to determine grid expansion needs and costs and how to evaluate your results.\n",
