    "### Electromobility data\n",
    "So far, adding electromobility data to an EDisGo object requires electromobility data from SimBEV (required version: [3083c5a](https://github.com/rl-institut/simbev/commit/86076c936940365587c9fba98a5b774e13083c5a))\n",
    "and TracBEV (required version: [14d864c](https://github.com/rl-institut/tracbev/commit/03e335655770a377166c05293a966052314d864c)) to be pre-generated. The data is currently not created automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have SimBEV and TracBEV data yet, you can use the data provided for this example for the ding0 grid downloaded above.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to import the electromobility data of the grid that you downloaded above and integrate charging points into the grid, you can use the function `EDisGo.import_electromobility`. Besides loading the electromobility data, the function also allocates the charging demand from SimBEV to charging sites from TracBEV and integrates the charging parks into the grid. This is further explained in the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Allocation of charging demand\n",
    "\n",
    "After electromobility data is loaded, the charging demand from SimBEV is allocated to potential charging parks from TracBEV. The allocation of the charging processes to the charging infrastructure is carried out with the help of the weighting factor of the potential charging parks determined by TracBEV. This involves a random and weighted selection of one charging park per charging process. In the case of private charging infrastructure, a separate charging point is set up for each EV. All charging processes of the respective EV and charging use case are assigned to this charging point.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the public charging infrastructure, the allocation is made explicitly per charging process. For each charging process it is determined whether a suitable charging point is already available. For this purpose it is checked whether the charging point is occupied by another EV in the corresponding period and whether it can provide the corresponding charging capacity. If no suitable charging point is available, a charging point is determined randomly and weighted in the same way as for private charging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Integration of charging parks\n",
    "\n",
    "After the allocation of charging demand to specific charging sites, all potential charging parks with charging demand allocated to them are integrated into the grid. This is realised the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If power rating is <= 0.3 MVA, the charging point is integrated into the LV grid, otherwise it is integrated into the MV grid.\n",
    "* Integration into LV grid:\n",
    "    * The considered charging point is integrated into the LV grid whose distribution substation is closest (this is currently done this way because the LV grids are not georeferenced but only the MV grid including the MV-LV substations).\n",
    "    * If power rating is > 0.1 MVA, the charging point is directly connected to the distribution substation.\n",
    "    * If power rating is <= 0.1 MVA, the type of connection depends on the charging point use case:\n",
    "        - Use Case `home`: Charging point is connected to a random household load in the identified LV grid.\n",
    "        - Use Case `work`: Charging point is connected to a random commercial, industrial or agricultural consumer.\n",
    "        - Use Case `public`: Charging point is connected to a random grid connection point in the identified LV grid.\n",
    "* Integration into MV grid:\n",
    "    * If the power rating of the charging point is > 4.5 MVA, it is directly connected to the HV-MV station.\n",
    "    * If the power rating of the charging point is <= 4.5 MVA, it is connected to the nearest grid connection point or cable. If a cable is selected, the line is cut at the point closest to the charging station and a new branch tee is added to which the charging station is connected."
