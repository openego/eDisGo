Usage details
=============

As eDisGo is designed to serve as a toolbox, it provides several methods to
analyze distribution grids for grid issues and to evaluate measures responding these.
Below, we give a detailed introduction to the data structure and to how different
features can be used.

The fundamental data structure
------------------------------

It's worth understanding how the fundamental data structure of eDisGo is
designed in order to make use of its entire features.

The class :class:`~.EDisGo` serves as the top-level API for
setting up your scenario, invocation of data import, analysis of hosting
capacity, grid reinforcement and flexibility measures. It also provides
access to all relevant data.
Grid data is stored in the :class:`~.network.topology.Topology` class.
Time series data can be found in the :class:`~.network.timeseries.TimeSeries`
class.
The class :class:`~.network.electromobility.Electromobility` holds data on charging
processes (how long cars are parking at a charging station, how much they need to charge,
etc.) necessary to apply different charging strategies, as well as information on
potential charging sites and integrated charging parks.
The class :class:`~.network.heat.HeatPump` holds data on
heat pump COP, heat demand to be served by the heat pumps and thermal storage units, which is
necessary to determine flexibility potential of heat pumps.
Results data holding results e.g. from the power flow analysis and grid
expansion is stored in the :class:`~.network.results.Results` class.
Configuration data from the config files (see :ref:`default_configs`) is stored
in the :class:`~.tools.config.Config` class.
All these can be accessed through the :class:`~.EDisGo` object. In the following
code examples `edisgo` constitues an :class:`~.EDisGo` object.

.. code-block:: python


    # Access Topology grid data container object
    edisgo.topology

    # Access TimeSeries data container object
    edisgo.timeseries

    # Access Electromobility data container object
    edisgo.electromobility

    # Access HeatPump data container object
    edisgo.heat_pump

    # Access Results data container object
    edisgo.results

    # Access configuration data container object
    edisgo.config

Grid data is stored in :pandas:`pandas.DataFrames<DataFrame>`
in the :class:`~.network.topology.Topology` object.
There are extra data frames for all
grid elements (buses, lines, switches, transformers), as well as generators,
loads and storage units.
You can access those dataframes as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # Access all buses in MV grid and underlying LV grids
    edisgo.topology.buses_df

    # Access all lines in MV grid and underlying LV grids
    edisgo.topology.lines_df

    # Access all MV/LV transformers
    edisgo.topology.transformers_df

    # Access all HV/MV transformers
    edisgo.topology.transformers_hvmv_df

    # Access all switches in MV grid and underlying LV grids
    edisgo.topology.switches_df

    # Access all generators in MV grid and underlying LV grids
    edisgo.topology.generators_df

    # Access all loads in MV grid and underlying LV grids
    edisgo.topology.loads_df

    # Access all storage units in MV grid and underlying LV grids
    edisgo.topology.storage_units_df

The grids can also be accessed individually. The MV grid is stored in an
:class:`~.network.grids.MVGrid` object and each LV grid in an
:class:`~.network.grids.LVGrid` object.
The MV grid topology can be accessed through

.. code-block:: python

    # Access MV grid
    edisgo.topology.mv_grid

Its components can be accessed analog to those of the whole grid topology as shown above.

.. code-block:: python

    # Access all buses in MV grid
    edisgo.topology.mv_grid.buses_df

    # Access all generators in MV grid
    edisgo.topology.mv_grid.generators_df

A list of all LV grids can be retrieved through:

.. code-block:: python

    # Get list of all underlying LV grids
    # (Note that MVGrid.lv_grids returns a generator object that must first be
    #  converted to a list in order to view the LVGrid objects)
    list(edisgo.topology.mv_grid.lv_grids)
    # the following yields the same
    list(edisgo.topology.lv_grids)

Access to a single LV grid's components can be obtained analog to shown above for
the whole topology and the MV grid:

.. code-block:: python

    # Get single LV grid by providing its ID (e.g. 1) or name (e.g. "LVGrid_1")
    lv_grid = edisgo.topology.get_lv_grid("LVGrid_402945")

    # Access all buses in that LV grid
    lv_grid.buses_df

    # Access all loads in that LV grid
    lv_grid.loads_df

A single grid's generators, loads, storage units and switches can also be
retrieved as :class:`~.network.components.Generator`,
:class:`~.network.components.Load`, :class:`~.network.components.Storage`, and
:class:`~.network.components.Switch` objects, respecitvely:

.. code-block:: python

    # Get all switch disconnectors in MV grid as Switch objects
    # (Note that objects are returned as a python generator object that must
    #  first be converted to a list in order to view the Switch objects)
    list(edisgo.topology.mv_grid.switch_disconnectors)

    # Get all generators in LV grid as Generator objects
    list(lv_grid.generators)

For some applications it is helpful to get a graph representation of the grid,
e.g. to find the path from the station to a generator. The graph representation
of the whole topology or each single grid can be retrieved as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # Get graph representation of whole topology
    edisgo.to_graph()

    # Get graph representation for MV grid
    edisgo.topology.mv_grid.graph

    # Get graph representation for LV grid
    lv_grid.graph

The returned graph is a :networkx:`networkx.Graph<network.Graph>`, where lines are represented
by edges in the graph, and buses and transformers are represented by nodes.

Component time series
------------------------

There are various options how to set active and reactive power time series. First, options
for setting active power time series are explained, followed by options for setting
reactive power time series.
You can also check out the :ref:`edisgo-mwe` section to get a quick start.

Active power time series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are various options how to set active time series:

* "manual": providing your own time series
* "worst-case": using simultaneity factors from config files
* "predefined": using predefined profiles, e.g. standard load profiles
* "optimised": using the LOPF to optimise e.g. vehicle charging
* "heuristic": using heuristics

.. _active_power_manual:

Manual
.......

Use this mode to provide your own time series for specific components.
It can be invoked as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    edisgo.set_time_series_manual()

See :attr:`~.edisgo.EDisGo.set_time_series_manual` for more information.

When using this mode make sure to previously set the time index. This can either be done
upon initialisation of the EDisGo object by providing the input parameter 'timeindex' or
by using the function :attr:`~.edisgo.EDisGo.set_timeindex`.

Worst-case
...........

Use this mode to set feed-in and load in heavy load flow case (here called "load_case")
and/or reverse power flow case (here called "feed-in_case") using simultaneity factors
used in conventional grid planning.
It can be invoked as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    edisgo.set_time_series_worst_case_analysis()

See :attr:`~.edisgo.EDisGo.set_time_series_worst_case_analysis` for more information.

When using this mode a fictitious time index starting 1/1/1970 00:00 is automatically set.
This is done because pypsa needs time indeces. To find out which time index corresponds
to which case check out:

.. code-block:: python

    edisgo.timeseries.timeindex_worst_cases

Predefined
.............

Use this mode if you want to set time series by component type.
You may either provide your own time series or use ones provided through the
OpenEnergy DataBase or other python tools.
This mode can be invoked as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    edisgo.set_time_series_active_power_predefined()

For the following components you can use existing time series:

* Fluctuating generators: Feed-in time series for solar and wind power plants can be
  retrieved from the `OpenEnergy DataBase <https://openenergy-platform.org/dataedit/schemas>`_.
* Conventional loads: Standard load profiles for the different sectors residential,
  commercial, agricultural and industrial are generated using the oemof
  `demandlib <https://github.com/oemof/demandlib/>`_.

For all other components you need to provide your own time series. Time series for
heat pumps cannot be set using this mode.
See :attr:`~.edisgo.EDisGo.set_time_series_active_power_predefined` for more information.

When using this mode make sure to previously set the time index. This can either be done
upon initialisation of the EDisGo object by providing the input parameter 'timeindex' or
by using the function :attr:`~.edisgo.EDisGo.set_timeindex`.

Optimised
..........

Use this mode to optimise flexibilities, e.g. charging of electric vehicles or
dispatch of heat pumps with thermal storage units.

.. todo:: Add more details once the optimisation is merged.

Heuristic
..........

Use this mode to use heuristics to set time series. So far, only heuristics for
electric vehicle charging are implemented.
The charging strategies can be invoked as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    edisgo.apply_charging_strategy()

See function docstring of :attr:`~.edisgo.EDisGo.apply_charging_strategy` or
documentation section :ref:`charging_strategies-label` for more information.

Further, there is currently one operating strategy for heat pumps implemented where
the heat demand is directly served by the heat pump without buffering heat using a
thermal storage.
The operating strategy can be invoked as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    edisgo.apply_heat_pump_operating_strategy()

See function docstring of :attr:`~.edisgo.EDisGo.apply_heat_pump_operating_strategy`
for more information.

Reactive power time series
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

There are so far two options how to set reactive power time series:

* "manual": providing your own time series
* "fixed :math:`cos\varphi`": using a fixed power factor

It is perspectively planned to also provide reactive power controls Q(U) and
:math:`cos\varphi(P)`.

Manual
.......

See active power :ref:`active_power_manual` mode documentation.

Fixed :math:`cos\varphi`
................................

Use this mode to set reactive power time series using fixed power factors.
It can be invoked as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    edisgo.set_time_series_reactive_power_control()

See :attr:`~.edisgo.EDisGo.set_time_series_reactive_power_control` for more information.

When using this mode make sure to previously set active power time series.

Identifying grid issues
-------------------------

As detailed in :ref:`edisgo-mwe`, once you set up your scenario by instantiating an
:class:`~.EDisGo` object, you are ready for a grid analysis and identifying grid
issues (line overloading and voltage issues) using :meth:`~.EDisGo.analyze`:

.. code-block:: python

    # Do non-linear power flow analysis for MV and LV grid
    edisgo.analyze()

The `analyze` function conducts a non-linear power flow using PyPSA.

The range of time analyzed by the power flow analysis is by default defined by the
:meth:`~edisgo.network.timeseries.TimeSeries.timeindex`, that can be given
as an input to the EDisGo object through the parameter `timeindex` or is
otherwise set automatically. If you want to change
the time steps that are analyzed, you can specify those through the parameter
*timesteps* of the `analyze` function.
Make sure that the specified time steps are a subset of
:meth:`~edisgo.network.timeseries.TimeSeries.timeindex`.

Grid expansion
--------------

Grid expansion can be invoked by :meth:`~.EDisGo.reinforce`:

.. code-block:: python

    # Reinforce grid due to overloading and overvoltage issues
    edisgo.reinforce()

You can further specify e.g. if to conduct a combined analysis for MV and LV
(regarding allowed voltage deviations) or if to only calculate grid expansion
needs without changing the topology of the graph. See
:func:`~.flex_opt.reinforce_grid.reinforce_grid` for more information.

Costs for the grid expansion measures can be obtained as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # Get costs of grid expansion
    costs = edisgo.results.grid_expansion_costs

Further information on the grid reinforcement methodology can be found in section
:ref:`grid_expansion_methodology`.

Electromobility
-----------------

Electromobility data including charging processes as well as information on potential charging sites and
integrated charging parks are stored in the
:class:`~.network.electromobility.Electromobility` object.

You can access these data as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # Access DataFrame with all SimBEV charging processes
    edisgo.electromobility.charging_processes_df

    # Access GeoDataFrame with all TracBEV potential charging parks
    edisgo.electromobility.potential_charging_parks_gdf

    # Access DataFrame with all charging parks that got integrated
    edisgo.electromobility.integrated_charging_parks_df

The integrated charging points are also stored in the :class:`~.network.topology.Topology`
object and can be accessed as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # Access DataFrame with all integrated charging points.
    edisgo.topology.charging_points_df


So far, adding electromobility data to an eDisGo object requires electromobility
data from `SimBEV <https://github.com/rl-institut/simbev>`_ (required version:
`3083c5a <https://github.com/rl-institut/simbev/commit/
86076c936940365587c9fba98a5b774e13083c5a>`_)
and `TracBEV <https://github.com/rl-institut/tracbev>`_ (required version:
`14d864c <https://github.com/rl-institut/tracbev/commit/
03e335655770a377166c05293a966052314d864c>`_) to be stored in the directories
specified through the parameters simbev_directory and tracbev_directory.
SimBEV provides data on standing times, charging demand, etc. per vehicle,
whereas TracBEV provides potential charging point locations.

.. todo:: Add information on how to retrieve SimBEV and TracBEV data

Here is a small example on how to import electromobility data and apply a
charging strategy. A more extensive example can be found in
the example jupyter notebook
`electromobility_example <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/blob/dev/examples/electromobility_example.ipynb>`_.

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd
    from edisgo import EDisGo

    # Set up the EDisGo object
    timeindex = pd.date_range("1/1/2011", periods=24*7, freq="H")
    edisgo = EDisGo(
        ding0_grid=dingo_grid_path,
        timeindex=timeindex
    )
    edisgo.set_time_series_active_power_predefined(
        fluctuating_generators_ts="oedb",
        dispatchable_generators_ts=pd.DataFrame(
            data=1, columns=["other"], index=timeindex),
        conventional_loads_ts="demandlib",
    )

    edisgo.set_time_series_reactive_power_control()

    # Resample edisgo timeseries to 15-minute resolution to match with SimBEV and
    # TracBEV data
    edisgo.resample_timeseries()

    # Import electromobility data
    edisgo.import_electromobility(
        simbev_directory=simbev_path,
        tracbev_directory=tracbev_path,
    )

    # Apply charging strategy
    edisgo.apply_charging_strategy(strategy="dumb")

Further information on the electromobility integration methodology and the charging
strategies can be found in section :ref:`electromobility-integration-label`.

Heat pumps
-----------------

Heat pump data including the heat pump's time variant COP, heat demand to be served
as well as thermal storage capacities are stored in the
:class:`~.network.heat.HeatPump` object.

You can access these data as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # Access DataFrame with COP time series
    edisgo.heat_pump.cop_df

    # Access DataFrame with heat demand time series
    edisgo.heat_pump.heat_demand_df

    # Access DataFrame with information on thermal storage capacities
    edisgo.heat_pump.thermal_storage_units_df

The heat pumps themselves are also stored in the :class:`~.network.topology.Topology`
object and can be accessed as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # Access DataFrame with all integrated heat pumps
    edisgo.topology.loads_df[edisgo.topology.loads_df.type == "heat_pump"]

Here is a small example on how to integrate a heat pump and apply an
operating strategy.

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd
    from edisgo import EDisGo

    # Set up the EDisGo object
    timeindex = pd.date_range("1/1/2011", periods=4, freq="H")
    edisgo = EDisGo(
        ding0_grid=dingo_grid_path,
        timeindex=timeindex
    )

    # Set up dummy heat pump data
    bus = edisgo.topology.loads_df[
        edisgo.topology.loads_df.sector == "residential"].bus[0]
    heat_pump_params = {"bus": bus, "p_set": 0.015, "type": "heat_pump"}

    cop = pd.Series([1.0, 2.0, 1.5, 3.4], index=timeindex)
    heat_demand = pd.Series([0.01, 0.03, 0.015, 0.0], index=timeindex)

    # Add heat pump to grid topology
    hp_name = edisgo.add_component("load", **heat_pump_params)

    # Add heat pump COP and heat demand to be served
    edisgo.heat_pump.set_cop(edisgo, cop.to_frame(name=hp_name))
    edisgo.heat_pump.set_heat_demand(edisgo, heat_demand.to_frame(name=hp_name))

    # Apply operating strategy - this sets the heat pump's dispatch time series
    # in timeseries.loads_active_power
    edisgo.apply_heat_pump_operating_strategy()

    hp_dispatch = edisgo.timeseries.loads_active_power.loc[:, hp_name]
    hp_dispatch.plot()

Battery storage systems
------------------------

Battery storage systems can be integrated into the grid as an alternative to
classical grid expansion.
Here are two small examples on how to integrate a storage unit manually. In the
first one, the EDisGo object is set up for a worst-case analysis, wherefore no
time series needs to be provided for the storage unit, as worst-case definition
is used. In the second example, a time series analysis is conducted, wherefore
a time series for the storage unit needs to be provided.

.. code-block:: python

    from edisgo import EDisGo

    # Set up EDisGo object
    edisgo = EDisGo(ding0_grid=dingo_grid_path)

    # Get random bus to connect storage to
    random_bus = edisgo.topology.buses_df.index[3]
    # Add storage instance
    edisgo.add_component(
        comp_type="storage_unit",
        add_ts=False,
        bus=random_bus,
        p_nom=4
    )

    # Set up worst case time series for loads, generators and storage unit
    edisgo.set_time_series_worst_case_analysis()


.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd
    from edisgo import EDisGo

    # Set up the EDisGo object
    timeindex = pd.date_range("1/1/2011", periods=4, freq="H")
    edisgo = EDisGo(
        ding0_grid=dingo_grid_path,
        generator_scenario="ego100",
        timeindex=timeindex
    )

    # Add time series for loads and generators
    timeseries_generation_dispatchable = pd.DataFrame(
        {"biomass": [1] * len(timeindex),
         "coal": [1] * len(timeindex),
         "other": [1] * len(timeindex)
         },
        index=timeindex
    )
    edisgo.set_time_series_active_power_predefined(
        conventional_loads_ts="demandlib",
        fluctuating_generators_ts="oedb",
        dispatchable_generators_ts=timeseries_generation_dispatchable
    )
    edisgo.set_time_series_reactive_power_control()

    # Add storage unit to random bus with time series
    edisgo.add_component(
        comp_type="storage_unit",
        bus=edisgo.topology.buses_df.index[3],
        p_nom=4,
        ts_active_power=pd.Series(
            [-3.4, 2.5, -3.4, 2.5],
            index=edisgo.timeseries.timeindex),
        ts_reactive_power=pd.Series(
            [0., 0., 0., 0.],
            index=edisgo.timeseries.timeindex)
    )

To optimise storage positioning and operation eDisGo provides the options to use a
heuristic (described in section :ref:`storage-integration-label`) or an optimal power
flow approach. However, the storage integration heuristic is not yet adapted to the
refactored code and therefore not available, and the OPF is not maintained and may therefore
not work out of the box.
Following you find an example on how to use the OPF to find the optimal storage
positions in the grid with regard to grid expansion costs. Storage operation
is optimized at the same time. The example uses the same EDisGo instance as
above. A total storage capacity of 10 MW is distributed in the grid. `storage_buses`
can be used to specify certain buses storage units may be connected to.
This does not need to be provided but will speed up the optimization.

.. code-block:: python

    random_bus = edisgo.topology.buses_df.index[3:13]
    edisgo.perform_mp_opf(
        timesteps=period,
        scenario="storage",
        storage_units=True,
        storage_buses=busnames,
        total_storage_capacity=10.0,
        results_path=results_path)

Curtailment
-----------

The curtailment function is used to spatially distribute the power that is to be curtailed.
To optimise which generators should be curtailed eDisGo provides the options to use a
heuristics (heuristics `feedin-proportional` and `voltage-based`, in detail explained
in section :ref:`curtailment_in_detail-label`) or an optimal power
flow approach. However, the heuristics are not yet adapted to the
refactored code and therefore not available, and the OPF is not maintained and may therefore
not work out of the box.

In the following example the optimal power flow is used to find the optimal generator
curtailment with regard to minimizing grid expansion costs for given
curtailment requirements. It uses the EDisGo object from above.

.. code-block:: python

    edisgo.perform_mp_opf(
        timesteps=period,
        scenario='curtailment',
        results_path=results_path,
        curtailment_requirement=True,
        curtailment_requirement_series=[10, 20, 15, 0])

Plots
----------------

EDisGo provides a bunch of predefined plots to e.g. plot the MV grid topology,
line loading and node voltages in the MV grid or as a histograms.

.. code-block:: python

    # plot MV grid topology on a map
    edisgo.plot_mv_grid_topology()

    # plot grid expansion costs for lines in the MV grid and stations on a map
    edisgo.plot_mv_grid_expansion_costs()

    # draw a plotly html figure showing relative loading and voltage deviation
    # in the MV grid
    from edisgo.tools.plots import draw_plotly
    draw_plotly(
        edisgo=edisgo,
        line_color="relative_loading",
        node_color="voltage_deviation",
    )

    # dash plot allowing to interactively toggle between different plotting options
    plot_dash(edisgo_objects=edisgo)

    # plot voltage histogram
    edisgo.histogram_voltage()

See :class:`~.EDisGo` class for more plots and plotting options.

Results
----------------

Results such as voltages at nodes and line loading from the power flow analysis as well as
grid expansion costs are provided through the :class:`~.network.results.Results` class
and can be accessed the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    edisgo.results

Get voltages at nodes from :meth:`~.network.results.Results.v_res`
and line loading from :meth:`~.network.results.Results.s_res` or
:attr:`~.network.results.Results.i_res`.
:attr:`~.network.results.Results.equipment_changes` holds details about measures
performed during grid expansion. Associated costs can be obtained through
:attr:`~.network.results.Results.grid_expansion_costs`.
Flexibility measures may not entirely resolve all issues.
These unresolved issues are listed in :attr:`~.network.results.Results.unresolved_issues`.

Results can be saved to csv files with:

.. code-block:: python

    edisgo.results.save('path/to/results/directory/')

See :meth:`~.network.results.Results.save` for more information.
