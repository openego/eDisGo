Usage details
=============

As eDisGo is designed to serve as a toolbox, it provides several methods to
analyze distribution grids for grid issues and to evaluate measures responding these.
Below, we give a detailed introduction to the data structure and to how different
features can be used.

The fundamental data structure
------------------------------

It's worth to understand how the fundamental data structure of eDisGo is
designed in order to make use of its entire features.

The class :class:`~.EDisGo` serves as the top-level API for
setting up your scenario, invocation of data import, analysis of hosting
capacity, grid reinforcement and flexibility measures. It also provides
access to all relevant data.
Grid data is stored in the :class:`~.network.topology.Topology` class.
Time series data can be found in the :class:`~.network.timeseries.TimeSeries`
class. Results data holding results e.g. from the power flow analysis and grid
expansion is stored in the :class:`~.network.results.Results` class.
Configuration data from the config files (see :ref:`default_configs`) is stored
in the :class:`~.tools.config.Config` class.
All these can be accessed through the :class:`~.EDisGo` object. In the following
code examples `edisgo` constitues an :class:`~.EDisGo` object.

.. code-block:: python


    # Access Topology grid data container object
    edisgo.topology

    # Access TimeSeries data container object
    edisgo.timeseries

    # Access Results data container object
    edisgo.results

    # Access configuration data container object
    edisgo.config

Grid data is stored in :pandas:`pandas.DataFrames<DataFrame>`
in the :class:`~.network.topology.Topology` object.
There are extra data frames for all
grid elements (buses, lines, switches, transformers), as well as generators,
loads and storage units.
You can access those dataframes as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # Access all buses in MV grid and underlying LV grids
    edisgo.topology.buses_df

    # Access all lines in MV grid and underlying LV grids
    edisgo.topology.lines_df

    # Access all MV/LV transformers
    edisgo.topology.transformers_df

    # Access all HV/MV transformers
    edisgo.topology.transformers_hvmv_df

    # Access all switches in MV grid and underlying LV grids
    edisgo.topology.switches_df

    # Access all generators in MV grid and underlying LV grids
    edisgo.topology.generators_df

    # Access all loads in MV grid and underlying LV grids
    edisgo.topology.loads_df

    # Access all storage units in MV grid and underlying LV grids
    edisgo.topology.storage_units_df

The grids can also be accessed individually. The MV grid is stored in an
:class:`~.network.grids.MVGrid` object and each LV grid in an
:class:`~.network.grids.LVGrid` object.
The MV grid topology can be accessed through

.. code-block:: python

    # Access MV grid
    edisgo.topology.mv_grid

Its components can be accessed analog to those of the whole grid topology as shown above.

.. code-block:: python

    # Access all buses in MV grid
    edisgo.topology.mv_grid.buses_df

    # Access all generators in MV grid
    edisgo.topology.mv_grid.generators_df

A list of all LV grids can be retrieved through:

.. code-block:: python

    # Get list of all underlying LV grids
    # (Note that MVGrid.lv_grids returns a generator object that must first be
    #  converted to a list in order to view the LVGrid objects)
    list(edisgo.topology.mv_grid.lv_grids)

Access to a single LV grid's components can be obtained analog to shown above for
the whole topology and the MV grid:

.. code-block:: python

    # Get single LV grid
    lv_grid = list(edisgo.topology.mv_grid.lv_grids)[0]

    # Access all buses in that LV grid
    lv_grid.buses_df

    # Access all loads in that LV grid
    lv_grid.loads_df

A single grid's generators, loads, storage units and switches can also be
retrieved as :class:`~.network.components.Generator`,
:class:`~.network.components.Load`, :class:`~.network.components.Storage`, and
:class:`~.network.components.Switch` objects, respecitvely:

.. code-block:: python

    # Get all switch disconnectors in MV grid as Switch objects
    # (Note that objects are returned as a python generator object that must
    #  first be converted to a list in order to view the Switch objects)
    list(edisgo.topology.mv_grid.switch_disconnectors)

    # Get all generators in LV grid as Generator objects
    list(lv_grid.generators)

For some applications it is helpful to get a graph representation of the grid,
e.g. to find the path from the station to a generator. The graph representation
of the whole topology or each single grid can be retrieved as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # Get graph representation of whole topology
    edisgo.to_graph()

    # Get graph representation for MV grid
    edisgo.topology.mv_grid.graph

    # Get graph representation for LV grid
    lv_grid.graph

The returned graph is a :networkx:`networkx.Graph<network.Graph>`, where lines are represented
by edges in the graph, and buses and transformers are represented by nodes.

Identify grid issues
--------------------

As detailed in :ref:`edisgo-mwe`, once you set up your scenario by instantiating an
:class:`~.EDisGo` object, you are ready for a grid analysis and identifying grid
issues (line overloading and voltage issues) using :meth:`~.EDisGo.analyze`:

.. code-block:: python

    # Do non-linear power flow analysis for MV and LV grid
    edisgo.analyze()

The `analyze` function conducts a non-linear power flow using PyPSA.

The range of time analyzed by the power flow analysis is by default defined by the
:meth:`~edisgo.network.timeseries.TimeSeries.timeindex`, that can be given
as an input to the EDisGo object through the parameter `timeindex` or is
otherwise set automatically. If you want to change
the time steps that are analyzed, you can specify those through the parameter
*timesteps* of the `analyze` function.
Make sure that the specified time steps are a subset of
:meth:`~edisgo.network.timeseries.TimeSeries.timeindex`.

Grid expansion
--------------

Grid expansion can be invoked by :meth:`~.EDisGo.reinforce`:

.. code-block:: python

    # Reinforce grid due to overloading and overvoltage issues
    edisgo.reinforce()

You can further specify e.g. if to conduct a combined analysis for MV and LV
(regarding allowed voltage deviations) or if to only calculate grid expansion
needs without changing the topology of the graph. See
:func:`~.flex_opt.reinforce_grid.reinforce_grid` for more information.

Costs for the grid expansion measures can be obtained as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    # Get costs of grid expansion
    costs = edisgo.results.grid_expansion_costs

Further information on the grid reinforcement methodology can be found in section
:ref:`grid_expansion_methodology`.

Battery storage systems
------------------------

Battery storage systems can be integrated into the grid as an alternative to
classical grid expansion.
The storage integration heuristic described in section
:ref:`storage-integration-label` is not available at the moment. Instead, you
may either integrate a storage unit at a specified bus manually or use the
optimal power flow to optimally distribute a given storage capacity in the grid.

Here are two small examples on how to integrate a storage unit manually. In the
first one, the EDisGo object is set up for a worst-case analysis, wherefore no
time series needs to be provided for the storage unit, as worst-case definition
is used. In the second example, a time series analysis is conducted, wherefore
a time series for the storage unit needs to be provided.

.. code-block:: python

    from edisgo import EDisGo

    # Set up EDisGo object
    edisgo = EDisGo(ding0_grid=dingo_grid_path,
                    worst_case_analysis='worst-case')

    # Get random bus to connect storage to
    random_bus = edisgo.topology.buses_df.index[3]
    # Add storage instance
    edisgo.add_component(
        "StorageUnit",
        bus=random_bus,
        p_nom=4)

.. code-block:: python

    import pandas as pd
    from edisgo import EDisGo

    # Set up the EDisGo object using the OpenEnergy DataBase and the oemof
    # demandlib to set up time series for loads and fluctuating generators
    # (time series for dispatchable generators need to be provided)
    timeindex = pd.date_range('1/1/2011', periods=4, freq='H')
    timeseries_generation_dispatchable = pd.DataFrame(
        {'biomass': [1] * len(timeindex),
         'coal': [1] * len(timeindex),
         'other': [1] * len(timeindex)
         },
        index=timeindex)
    edisgo = EDisGo(
        ding0_grid='ding0_example_grid',
        generator_scenario='ego100',
        timeseries_load='demandlib',
        timeseries_generation_fluctuating='oedb',
        timeseries_generation_dispatchable=timeseries_generation_dispatchable,
        timeindex=timeindex)

    # Get random bus to connect storage to
    random_bus = edisgo.topology.buses_df.index[3]
    # Add storage instance
    edisgo.add_component(
        "StorageUnit",
        bus=random_bus,
        p_nom=4,
        ts_active_power=pd.Series(
            [-3.4, 2.5, -3.4, 2.5],
            index=edisgo.timeseries.timeindex))

Following is an example on how to use the OPF to find the optimal storage
positions in the grid with regard to grid expansion costs. Storage operation
is optimized at the same time. The example uses the same EDisGo instance as
above. A total storage capacity of 10 MW is distributed in the grid. `storage_buses`
can be used to specify certain buses storage units may be connected to.
This does not need to be provided but will speed up the optimization.

.. code-block:: python

    random_bus = edisgo.topology.buses_df.index[3:13]
    edisgo.perform_mp_opf(
        timesteps=period,
        scenario="storage",
        storage_units=True,
        storage_buses=busnames,
        total_storage_capacity=10.0,
        results_path=results_path)

Curtailment
-----------

The curtailment function is used to spatially distribute the power that is to be curtailed.
The two heuristics `feedin-proportional` and `voltage-based`, in detail explained
in section :ref:`curtailment_in_detail-label`, are currently not available.
Instead you may use the optimal power flow to find the optimal generator
curtailment with regard to minimizing grid expansion costs for given
curtailment requirements. The following example again uses the EDisGo object
from above.

.. code-block:: python

    edisgo.perform_mp_opf(
        timesteps=period,
        scenario='curtailment',
        results_path=results_path,
        curtailment_requirement=True,
        curtailment_requirement_series=[10, 20, 15, 0])

Plots
----------------

EDisGo provides a bunch of predefined plots to e.g. plot the MV grid topology,
line loading and node voltages in the MV grid or as a histograms.

.. code-block:: python

    # plot MV grid topology on a map
    edisgo.plot_mv_grid_topology()

    # plot grid expansion costs for lines in the MV grid and stations on a map
    edisgo.plot_mv_grid_expansion_costs()

    # plot voltage histogram
    edisgo.histogram_voltage()

See :class:`~.EDisGo` class for more plots and plotting options.

Results
----------------

Results such as voltages at nodes and line loading from the power flow analysis as well as
grid expansion costs are provided through the :class:`~.network.results.Results` class
and can be accessed the following way:

.. code-block:: python

    edisgo.results

Get voltages at nodes from :meth:`~.network.results.Results.v_res`
and line loading from :meth:`~.network.results.Results.s_res` or
:attr:`~.network.results.Results.i_res`.
:attr:`~.network.results.Results.equipment_changes` holds details about measures
performed during grid expansion. Associated costs can be obtained through
:attr:`~.network.results.Results.grid_expansion_costs`.
Flexibility measures may not entirely resolve all issues.
These unresolved issues are listed in :attr:`~.network.results.Results.unresolved_issues`.

Results can be saved to csv files with:

.. code-block:: python

    edisgo.results.save('path/to/results/directory/')

See :meth:`~.network.results.Results.save` for more information.
