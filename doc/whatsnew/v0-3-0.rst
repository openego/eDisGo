Changes
-------

* Added functionalities to obtain electromobility, DSM, storage and electricity timeseries data from oedb `#328 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/pull/328>`_
* Added functionalities to obtain heat pump data from oedb `#324 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/pull/324>`_
* Added functionality to resample and check integrity of flexibility bands `#341 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/pull/341>`_
* Added spatial complexity reduction methods `#343 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/pull/343>`_
* Added function to sort buses in lines dataframe such that bus0 is always the upstream bus `#335 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/pull/335>`_
* Changed to_pypsa function such that pypsa network can be build even though not all components have time series `#335 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/pull/335>`_
* Added class holding data from overlying grid, such as curtailment requirements and
  conventional generator dispatch `#335 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/pull/335>`_

* Refactoring of check_tech_constraints functions `#290 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/pull/290>`_
* Add background map to plots `#346 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/pull/364>`_
* Added method to scale timeseries `#353 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/pull/353>`_
* Added method to iteratively reinforce a grid in case the power flow analysis does not always converge `#353 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/pull/353>`_
* Added method to aggregate LV grid buses to station bus secondary side `#353 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/pull/353>`_
* Adapted codebase to work with pandas 2.0 `#373 <https://github.com/openego/eDisGo/pull/373>`_
