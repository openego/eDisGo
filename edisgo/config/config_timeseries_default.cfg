# This file contains relevant data to generate load and feed-in time series.
# Peakload consumption ratios and scale factors are used in worst-case scenarios.
# Power factors are used to generate reactive power time series.

# ===========================
# ratios of peak load to annual consumption per sector based on BDEW synthetic
# load profiles; used only in worst case analyses

# scale factors
# ===========================
# scale factors describe actual power to nominal power ratio of generators and loads in worst-case scenarios
