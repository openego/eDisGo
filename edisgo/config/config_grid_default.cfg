# Upper limits for nominal capacity in MW at which generators, loads and storage units are
# integrated into a certain voltage level. The voltage levels have the following meaning:
# voltage level 7 = LV grid
# voltage level 6 = LV side of MV-LV station
# voltage level 5 =  MV grid
# voltage level 4 = MV side of HV-MS station
# The upper limit of one voltage level at the same time signifies the lower limit of
# the next higher voltage level, i.e. upper limit of voltage limit 7 is lower limit for
# voltage level 6.

# Positioning of disconnecting points: Can be position at location of most
