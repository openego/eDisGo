    Reinforce measures:

    1. Disconnect line at 2/3 of the length between station and critical node

    2. Install parallel standard line

    In LV grids only lines outside buildings are reinforced; loads and
    generators in buildings cannot be directly connected to the MV/LV station.

    In MV grids lines can only be disconnected at LV stations because they
    have switch disconnectors needed to operate the lines as half rings (loads
    in MV would be suitable as well because they have a switch bay (Schaltfeld)
    but loads in dingo are only connected to MV busbar). If there is no
    suitable LV station the generator is directly connected to the MV busbar.
    There is no need for a switch disconnector in that case because generators
    don't need to be n-1 safe.

    """
    Separate LV grid by adding a new substation and connect half of each feeder.

    If a feeder cannot be split because it has too few nodes or too few nodes outside a
    building, each second inept feeder is connected to the new LV grid. The new LV grid
    is equipped with standard transformers until the nominal apparent power is at least
    the same as in the original LV grid. The new substation is at the same location as
    the originating substation. The workflow is as follows:

    * The point at half the length of the feeders is determined.
    * The first node following this point is chosen as the point where the new
      connection will be made.
    * New MV/LV station is connected to the existing MV/LV station.
    * The determined nodes are disconnected from the previous nodes and connected to the
      new MV/LV station.

    Notes:

    * The name of the new LV grid will be a combination of the originating existing grid
      ID. E.g. 40000 + X = 40000X
    * The name of the lines in the new LV grid are the same as in the grid where the
      nodes were removed
